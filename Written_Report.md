Draws two correct conclusions or comparisons from the calculations (10 points)
1. interestingly, if you see the average math and reading scores by schools & grades, there's difference by schools but students' grade don't improve within same school from 9th to 12th grade.  From this, I can conclude that students grade depends on which school they go to. 

2. I can also conclude from looking at student's performance by school's size and type that the data shows larger schools and disctrict schools have meaningfully lower student performance than the charter schools and small to medium size schools.
